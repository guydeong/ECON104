# ECON 104 - UCLA, Fall Quarter 2023
This Repository contains my project solutions for UCLA Fall 2023 ECON 104 (Data Science for Economists) with Professor Kimberly Boswell. In this course, I learned the various regression models and assumptions to model cross-section, time-series, and panel data. Specifically, the course explored topics in Heteroskedasticity, Time-Series and Autocorrelation, Endogeneity and Instrumental Variables, Pooled Regression, Random Effects Model, Fixed Effects Model, Binary Dependent Models, Multinomial Models, and Regularization Methods. This course consisted of 3 Project Assignments, with Project 2 being my favorite.

## Project Scores
| Project   | Grade | Brief Description | 
| :---:      |    :---:      |          :---: |
| Project 1 |   68/70   |  Analyzed the Murder Rate Cross-Section data in the year 1950. Tested and corrected for heteroskedasticity in the model, as well as determined the model's functional form using the RESET test   |
| Project 2 |   49/50   | Explored the USGasB Time-Series data from 1950 to 1987. Found whether the data fitted an AR or ARDL model, the degree of the autoregressive and distributed lag part of the model, tested and corrected for stationarity, and tested if the model exhibited evidence of autocorrelation. |
| Project 3 |   65/65   |  Examined the Cigar Panel Dataset that contained 46 time observations from 1963 to 1992 and 1380 cross-sectional units about cigarette consumption data. Determined whether the fixed effect or random effects model was used to explain heterogeneity across the cross-sectional units. Inspected the credit card binary data set that examined whether or not an individual received a credit card. Determined whether the linear probability model, probit model, or logit model best fit the data. |
