# ECON 104 - UCLA, Fall Quarter 2023
This Repository contains my project solutions for UCLA Fall 2023 ECON 104 (Data Science for Economists) with Professor Kimberly Boswell. In this course, I learned the various regression models and assumptions to model cross-section, time-series, and panel data. Specifically, the course explored topics in Heteroskedasticity, Time-Series and Autocorrelation, Endogeneity and Instrumental Variables, Pooled Regression, Randome Effects Model, Fixed Effects Model, Binary Dependent Models, Multinomial Models, and Regularization Methods. This course consisted of 3 Project Assignments, with Project 2 being my favorite.
