# ECON 104 - UCLA, Fall Quarter 2023
This Repository contains my project solutions for UCLA Fall 2023 ECON 104 (Data Science for Economists) with Professor Kimberly Boswell. In this course, I learned the various regression models and assumptions to model cross-section, time-series, and panel data. Specifically, the course explored topics in Heteroskedasticity, Time-Series and Autocorrelation, Endogeneity and Instrumental Variables, Pooled Regression, Random Effects Model, Fixed Effects Model, Binary Dependent Models, Multinomial Models, and Regularization Methods. This course consisted of 3 Project Assignments, with Project 2 being my favorite.

## Project Scores
| Project   | Grade | Brief Description | Answered the following question: |
| :---:      |    :---:      |          :---: | :---:                       |
| Project 1 |   68/70   |  Analyzed the Murder Rate Cross-Section data in the year 1950. Tested and corrected for heteroskedasticity in the model, as well as determined the model's function form using the RESET test   | Does the Median family
income in 1950 (in 1,000 USD) or the median time served (in months) of convicted murderers released in 1950 have an equal effect in reducing murder rates in states?|
| Project 2 |   49/50   |  Created sequence class with linked list as the underlying data structure from scratch |
| Project 3 |   65/65   |  Constructed Mancala game and Implemented Game AI using Min-Max Algorithm  |
